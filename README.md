# Academic Platform

This is the frontend side of an academic platform made to a particular organization. Built with JavaScript. Still in development

##The Platform
At first glance, there is going to be a login page where you got to login to your account. After you are in, you will be able to se your profile and
the programs you are in. Also, there's a menu bar to navigate either to the grades page, get back to the profile page or logout. 
Also I'm looking forward to program the auth process for different users: 
- Admin
- Teacher
- Student

## Getting Started with Create React App
